# CuoreUI.Winforms
> [!NOTE]
> CuoreUI is in development

This is a C# .NET Winforms Library with <ins>modern-looking</ins> controls, components and forms.<br>
The library features many controls with a sleek design inspired by Xiaomi and modern Web UI design.<br>
The library does everything <ins>decently</ins>, for more special-case controls check out other libraries, like Siticone (or use WPF). 

## üóø Why use Cuore
Many promise to give you a *"modern design"*, but they can sometimes look old or feel clunky.

So, CuoreUI draws inspiration from the latest modern, *often web* designs.<br>
We can blur or animate your control, round up your form's corners, yet **look good**, while being lightweight.
