# CuoreUI.Winforms
> [!NOTE]
> CuoreUI is in development

This is a C# .NET Winforms Library with *modern-looking* controls, components and forms.<br>
The library features many controls with a sleek design inspired by Xiaomi and modern web design.<br>

## üóø Why use Cuore
Many promise to give you a *"modern design"*, but they can sometimes look old or feel clunky.

So, CuoreUI draws inspiration from the latest modern, *often web* designs.<br>
Supports control animations, blur controls, and rounded forms for a sleek, modern look, yet is lightweight.
