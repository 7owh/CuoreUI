# 🐞 Troubleshooting

> ## "CuoreUI Controls don't show up in the toolbox"

1) Make sure you **download the CuoreUI.dll which is compatible** with your project.

For example, a `.NET Framework 4.7.2` project cannot import a `.net 8` project

2) **Restart your Visual Studio** application.

Sometimes, you just need to reopen your project and the toolbox will populate properly.
