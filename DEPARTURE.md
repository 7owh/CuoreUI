# Main topic
Hello Cuore followers.<br>
I **am**, in fact, **leaving** most of the **things** I've had **online behind**.<br>
It's related to my privacy and wellbeing, and I think this is for the best for me.<br>

I wil update CuoreUI for the last time on the **30th March 2025**.<br>
Right after the update, if no new owner emerges, CuoreUI will become archived.

The future isn't clear, but I'll make sure the original CuoreUI is left free and open-source.<br>
The forks - do what you want, I really do not care (you can even sell your own versions).

# What have we created?
It's very saddening seeing the project come to life the most when I'm also struggling the most.<br>
Additionally, CuoreUI was intended to be updated atleast once each month, but lately I've been finding it harder and harder to manage just that.
### However let's not sorrow anymore, but celebrate what we had achieved!
I was obsessed with checking the graphs and downloads everyday, seeing as more and more people used CuoreUI.<br>
It felt awesome that there were people out there that actually used this over say: Guna, or Bunifu<br>
I had speculated that by Q2 2025, CuoreUI will have had 10.000 downloads.. I still do, even though it will be archived.<br>
## 8618 DOWNLOADS (28th March 2025)

This graph is very beautiful. It shows the steady growth of word-of-mouth.<br>
23rd February - 9th March showed a really weird jump in downloads, and I was positively surprised at that time.
Even if the steady flow were returning users, it actually still meant and will mean a lot to me.
## OUR WEBSITE

Starting with a template and then redoing it from scratch.
I loved breaking from C# and coding the website in free time, with each iteration it was becoming more beautiful.
My last efforts were on optimizing the assets for minimum bandwidth usage.
I had purified and minified the obvious .css files. As for the .svg files, most of them were manually remade by me in Inkscape.
As stupid as it sounds, this had a HUGE positive effect on the loading speeds-
My phone used to load the website very slowly, but after said upgrade to the website, it felt instant!

# THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THIS JOURNEY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ACHIEVING SIMILAR THINGS UNDER A NEW INTERNET ALIAS
